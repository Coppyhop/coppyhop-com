			<p>Hi! I am Coppy (Kyle) Bredenkamp, a 21 year old with a passion for computing. I am from Tucson, Arizona and currently am almost there to getting a bachelor's in Computer Science. (1 more semester!). In my free time I like to play video games, chat with friends, and create interesting scripts and programs.</p>
